/*

* Quickstart

  This library is all in one file to simplify the most common usage:
  ftp it, compile it (-O3), and link it into another program. All of
  the compile-time options default to reasonable values for use on
  most platforms.  You might later want to step through various
  compile-time and dynamic tuning options.

  For convenience, an include file for code using this malloc is at:
     ftp://gee.cs.oswego.edu/pub/misc/malloc-2.8.6.h
  You don't really need this .h file unless you call functions not
  defined in your system include files.  The .h file contains only the
  excerpts from this file needed for using this malloc on ANSI C/C++
  systems, so long as you haven't changed compile-time options about
  naming and tuning parameters.  If you do, then you can create your
  own malloc.h that does include all settings by cutting at the point
  indicated below. Note that you may already by default be using a C
  library containing a malloc that is based on some version of this
  malloc (for example in linux). You might still want to use the one
  in this file to customize settings or to avoid overheads associated
  with library versions.

* Vital statistics:

  Supported pointer/size_t representation:       4 or 8 bytes
       size_t MUST be an unsigned type of the same width as
       pointers. (If you are using an ancient system that declares
       size_t as a signed type, or need it to be a different width
       than pointers, you can use a previous release of this malloc
       (e.g. 2.7.2) supporting these.)

  Alignment:                                     8 bytes (minimum)
       This suffices for nearly all current machines and C compilers.
       However, you can define MALLOC_ALIGNMENT to be wider than this
       if necessary (up to 128bytes), at the expense of using more space.

  Minimum overhead per allocated chunk:   4 or  8 bytes (if 4byte sizes)
                                          8 or 16 bytes (if 8byte sizes)
       Each malloced chunk has a hidden word of overhead holding size
       and status information, and additional cross-check word
       if FOOTERS is defined.

  Minimum allocated size: 4-byte ptrs:  16 bytes    (including overhead)
                          8-byte ptrs:  32 bytes    (including overhead)

       Even a request for zero bytes (i.e., malloc(0)) returns a
       pointer to something of the minimum allocatable size.
       The maximum overhead wastage (i.e., number of extra bytes
       allocated than were requested in malloc) is less than or equal
       to the minimum size, except for requests >= mmap_threshold that
       are serviced via mmap(), where the worst case wastage is about
       32 bytes plus the remainder from a system page (the minimal
       mmap unit); typically 4096 or 8192 bytes.

  Security: static-safe; optionally more or less
       The "security" of malloc refers to the ability of malicious
       code to accentuate the effects of errors (for example, freeing
       space that is not currently malloc'ed or overwriting past the
       ends of chunks) in code that calls malloc.  This malloc
       guarantees not to modify any memory locations below the base of
       heap, i.e., static variables, even in the presence of usage
       errors.  The routines additionally detect most improper frees
       and reallocs.  All this holds as long as the static bookkeeping
       for malloc itself is not corrupted by some other means.  This
       is only one aspect of security -- these checks do not, and
       cannot, detect all possible programming errors.

       If FOOTERS is defined nonzero, then each allocated chunk
       carries an additional check word to verify that it was malloced
       from its space.  These check words are the same within each
       execution of a program using malloc, but differ across
       executions, so externally crafted fake chunks cannot be
       freed. This improves security by rejecting frees/reallocs that
       could corrupt heap memory, in addition to the checks preventing
       writes to statics that are always on.  This may further improve
       security at the expense of time and space overhead.  (Note that
       FOOTERS may also be worth using with MSPACES.)

       By default detected errors cause the program to abort (calling
       "abort()"). You can override this to instead proceed past
       errors by defining PROCEED_ON_ERROR.  In this case, a bad free
       has no effect, and a malloc that encounters a bad address
       caused by user overwrites will ignore the bad address by
       dropping pointers and indices to all known memory. This may
       be appropriate for programs that should continue if at all
       possible in the face of programming errors, although they may
       run out of memory because dropped memory is never reclaimed.

       If you don't like either of these options, you can define
       CORRUPTION_ERROR_ACTION and USAGE_ERROR_ACTION to do anything
       else. And if if you are sure that your program using malloc has
       no errors or vulnerabilities, you can define INSECURE to 1,
       which might (or might not) provide a small performance improvement.

       It is also possible to limit the maximum total allocatable
       space, using malloc_set_footprint_limit. This is not
       designed as a security feature in itself (calls to set limits
       are not screened or privileged), but may be useful as one
       aspect of a secure implementation.

  Thread-safety: thread-safe unless USE_LOCKS defined to zero
       When USE_LOCKS is defined, each public call to malloc, free,
       etc is surrounded with a lock. By default, this uses a plain
       pthread mutex, win32 critical section, or a spin-lock if if
       available for the platform and not disabled by setting
       USE_SPIN_LOCKS=0.  However, if USE_RECURSIVE_LOCKS is defined,
       recursive versions are used instead (which are not required for
       base functionality but may be needed in layered extensions).
       Using a global lock is not especially fast, and can be a major
       bottleneck.  It is designed only to provide minimal protection
       in concurrent environments, and to provide a basis for
       extensions.  If you are using malloc in a concurrent program,
       consider instead using nedmalloc
       (http://www.nedprod.com/programs/portable/nedmalloc/) or
       ptmalloc (See http://www.malloc.de), which are derived from
       versions of this malloc.

  System requirements: Any combination of MORECORE and/or MMAP/MUNMAP
       This malloc can use unix sbrk or any emulation (invoked using
       the CALL_MORECORE macro) and/or mmap/munmap or any emulation
       (invoked using CALL_MMAP/CALL_MUNMAP) to get and release system
       memory.  On most unix systems, it tends to work best if both
       MORECORE and MMAP are enabled.  On Win32, it uses emulations
       based on VirtualAlloc. It also uses common C library functions
       like memset.

  Compliance: I believe it is compliant with the Single Unix Specification
       (See http://www.unix.org). Also SVID/XPG, ANSI C, and probably
       others as well.

* Overview of algorithms

  This is not the fastest, most space-conserving, most portable, or
  most tunable malloc ever written. However it is among the fastest
  while also being among the most space-conserving, portable and
  tunable.  Consistent balance across these factors results in a good
  general-purpose allocator for malloc-intensive programs.

  In most ways, this malloc is a best-fit allocator. Generally, it
  chooses the best-fitting existing chunk for a request, with ties
  broken in approximately least-recently-used order. (This strategy
  normally maintains low fragmentation.) However, for requests less
  than 256bytes, it deviates from best-fit when there is not an
  exactly fitting available chunk by preferring to use space adjacent
  to that used for the previous small request, as well as by breaking
  ties in approximately most-recently-used order. (These enhance
  locality of series of small allocations.)  And for very large requests
  (>= 256Kb by default), it relies on system memory mapping
  facilities, if supported.  (This helps avoid carrying around and
  possibly fragmenting memory used only for large chunks.)

  All operations (except malloc_stats and mallinfo) have execution
  times that are bounded by a constant factor of the number of bits in
  a size_t, not counting any clearing in calloc or copying in realloc,
  or actions surrounding MORECORE and MMAP that have times
  proportional to the number of non-contiguous regions returned by
  system allocation routines, which is often just 1. In real-time
  applications, you can optionally suppress segment traversals using
  NO_SEGMENT_TRAVERSAL, which assures bounded execution even when
  system allocators return non-contiguous spaces, at the typical
  expense of carrying around more memory and increased fragmentation.

  The implementation is not very modular and seriously overuses
  macros. Perhaps someday all C compilers will do as good a job
  inlining modular code as can now be done by brute-force expansion,
  but now, enough of them seem not to.

  Some compilers issue a lot of warnings about code that is
  dead/unreachable only on some platforms, and also about intentional
  uses of negation on unsigned types. All known cases of each can be
  ignored.

  For a longer but out of date high-level description, see
     http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html

* MSPACES
  If MSPACES is defined, then in addition to malloc, free, etc.,
  this file also defines mspace_malloc, mspace_free, etc. These
  are versions of malloc routines that take an "mspace" argument
  obtained using create_mspace, to control all internal bookkeeping.
  If ONLY_MSPACES is defined, only these versions are compiled.
  So if you would like to use this allocator for only some allocations,
  and your system malloc for others, you can compile with
  ONLY_MSPACES and then do something like...
    static mspace mymspace = create_mspace(0,0); // for example
    #define mymalloc(bytes)  mspace_malloc(mymspace, bytes)

  (Note: If you only need one instance of an mspace, you can instead
  use "USE_DL_PREFIX" to relabel the global malloc.)

  You can similarly create thread-local allocators by storing
  mspaces as thread-locals. For example:
    static __thread mspace tlms = 0;
    void*  tlmalloc(size_t bytes) {
      if (tlms == 0) tlms = create_mspace(0, 0);
      return mspace_malloc(tlms, bytes);
    }
    void  tlfree(void* mem) { mspace_free(tlms, mem); }

  Unless FOOTERS is defined, each mspace is completely independent.
  You cannot allocate from one and free to another (although
  conformance is only weakly checked, so usage errors are not always
  caught). If FOOTERS is defined, then each chunk carries around a tag
  indicating its originating mspace, and frees are directed to their
  originating spaces. Normally, this requires use of locks.

 -------------------------  Compile-time options ---------------------------

Be careful in setting #define values for numerical constants of type
size_t. On some systems, literal values are not automatically extended
to size_t precision unless they are explicitly casted. You can also
use the symbolic values MAX_SIZE_T, SIZE_T_ONE, etc below.

WIN32                    default: defined if _WIN32 defined
  Defining WIN32 sets up defaults for MS environment and compilers.
  Otherwise defaults are for unix. Beware that there seem to be some
  cases where this malloc might not be a pure drop-in replacement for
  Win32 malloc: Random-looking failures from Win32 GDI API's (eg;
  SetDIBits()) may be due to bugs in some video driver implementations
  when pixel buffers are malloc()ed, and the region spans more than
  one VirtualAlloc()ed region. Because dlmalloc uses a small (64Kb)
  default granularity, pixel buffers may straddle virtual allocation
  regions more often than when using the Microsoft allocator.  You can
  avoid this by using VirtualAlloc() and VirtualFree() for all pixel
  buffers rather than using malloc().  If this is not possible,
  recompile this malloc with a larger DEFAULT_GRANULARITY. Note:
  in cases where MSC and gcc (cygwin) are known to differ on WIN32,
  conditions use _MSC_VER to distinguish them.

DLMALLOC_EXPORT       default: extern
  Defines how public APIs are declared. If you want to export via a
  Windows DLL, you might define this as
    #define DLMALLOC_EXPORT extern  __declspec(dllexport)
  If you want a POSIX ELF shared object, you might use
    #define DLMALLOC_EXPORT extern __attribute__((visibility("default")))

MALLOC_ALIGNMENT         default: (size_t)(2 * sizeof(void *))
  Controls the minimum alignment for malloc'ed chunks.  It must be a
  power of two and at least 8, even on machines for which smaller
  alignments would suffice. It may be defined as larger than this
  though. Note however that code and data structures are optimized for
  the case of 8-byte alignment.

MSPACES                  default: 0 (false)
  If true, compile in support for independent allocation spaces.
  This is only supported if HAVE_MMAP is true.

ONLY_MSPACES             default: 0 (false)
  If true, only compile in mspace versions, not regular versions.

USE_LOCKS                default: 1 (true)
  Causes each call to each public routine to be surrounded with
  pthread or WIN32 mutex lock/unlock. (If set true, this can be
  overridden on a per-mspace basis for mspace versions.) If set to a
  non-zero value other than 1, locks are used, but their
  implementation is left out, so lock functions must be supplied manually,
  as described below.

USE_SPIN_LOCKS           default: 1 iff USE_LOCKS and spin locks available
  If true, uses custom spin locks for locking. This is currently
  supported only gcc >= 4.1, older gccs on x86 platforms, and recent
  MS compilers.  Otherwise, posix locks or win32 critical sections are
  used.

USE_RECURSIVE_LOCKS      default: not defined
  If defined nonzero, uses recursive (aka reentrant) locks, otherwise
  uses plain mutexes. This is not required for malloc proper, but may
  be needed for layered allocators such as nedmalloc.

LOCK_AT_FORK            default: not defined
  If defined nonzero, performs pthread_atfork upon initialization
  to initialize child lock while holding parent lock. The implementation
  assumes that pthread locks (not custom locks) are being used. In other
  cases, you may need to customize the implementation.

FOOTERS                  default: 0
  If true, provide extra checking and dispatching by placing
  information in the footers of allocated chunks. This adds
  space and time overhead.

INSECURE                 default: 0
  If true, omit checks for usage errors and heap space overwrites.

USE_DL_PREFIX            default: NOT defined
  Causes compiler to prefix all public routines with the string 'dl'.
  This can be useful when you only want to use this malloc in one part
  of a program, using your regular system malloc elsewhere.

MALLOC_INSPECT_ALL       default: NOT defined
  If defined, compiles malloc_inspect_all and mspace_inspect_all, that
  perform traversal of all heap space.  Unless access to these
  functions is otherwise restricted, you probably do not want to
  include them in secure implementations.

ABORT                    default: defined as abort()
  Defines how to abort on failed checks.  On most systems, a failed
  check cannot die with an "assert" or even print an informative
  message, because the underlying print routines in turn call malloc,
  which will fail again.  Generally, the best policy is to simply call
  abort(). It's not very useful to do more than this because many
  errors due to overwriting will show up as address faults (null, odd
  addresses etc) rather than malloc-triggered checks, so will also
  abort.  Also, most compilers know that abort() does not return, so
  can better optimize code conditionally calling it.

PROCEED_ON_ERROR           default: defined as 0 (false)
  Controls whether detected bad addresses cause them to bypassed
  rather than aborting. If set, detected bad arguments to free and
  realloc are ignored. And all bookkeeping information is zeroed out
  upon a detected overwrite of freed heap space, thus losing the
  ability to ever return it from malloc again, but enabling the
  application to proceed. If PROCEED_ON_ERROR is defined, the
  static variable malloc_corruption_error_count is compiled in
  and can be examined to see if errors have occurred. This option
  generates slower code than the default abort policy.

DEBUG                    default: NOT defined
  The DEBUG setting is mainly intended for people trying to modify
  this code or diagnose problems when porting to new platforms.
  However, it may also be able to better isolate user errors than just
  using runtime checks.  The assertions in the check routines spell
  out in more detail the assumptions and invariants underlying the
  algorithms.  The checking is fairly extensive, and will slow down
  execution noticeably. Calling malloc_stats or mallinfo with DEBUG
  set will attempt to check every non-mmapped allocated and free chunk
  in the course of computing the summaries.

ABORT_ON_ASSERT_FAILURE   default: defined as 1 (true)
  Debugging assertion failures can be nearly impossible if your
  version of the assert macro causes malloc to be called, which will
  lead to a cascade of further failures, blowing the runtime stack.
  ABORT_ON_ASSERT_FAILURE cause assertions failures to call abort(),
  which will usually make debugging easier.

MALLOC_FAILURE_ACTION     default: sets errno to ENOMEM, or no-op on win32
  The action to take before "return 0" when malloc fails to be able to
  return memory because there is none available.

HAVE_MORECORE             default: 1 (true) unless win32 or ONLY_MSPACES
  True if this system supports sbrk or an emulation of it.

MORECORE                  default: sbrk
  The name of the sbrk-style system routine to call to obtain more
  memory.  See below for guidance on writing custom MORECORE
  functions. The type of the argument to sbrk/MORECORE varies across
  systems.  It cannot be size_t, because it supports negative
  arguments, so it is normally the signed type of the same width as
  size_t (sometimes declared as "intptr_t").  It doesn't much matter
  though. Internally, we only call it with arguments less than half
  the max value of a size_t, which should work across all reasonable
  possibilities, although sometimes generating compiler warnings.

MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS       default: 1 (true) if HAVE_MORECORE
  If true, take advantage of fact that consecutive calls to MORECORE
  with positive arguments always return contiguous increasing
  addresses.  This is true of unix sbrk. It does not hurt too much to
  set it true anyway, since malloc copes with non-contiguities.
  Setting it false when definitely non-contiguous saves time
  and possibly wasted space it would take to discover this though.

MORECORE_CANNOT_TRIM      default: NOT defined
  True if MORECORE cannot release space back to the system when given
  negative arguments. This is generally necessary only if you are
  using a hand-crafted MORECORE function that cannot handle negative
  arguments.

NO_SEGMENT_TRAVERSAL       default: 0
  If non-zero, suppresses traversals of memory segments
  returned by either MORECORE or CALL_MMAP. This disables
  merging of segments that are contiguous, and selectively
  releasing them to the OS if unused, but bounds execution times.

HAVE_MMAP                 default: 1 (true)
  True if this system supports mmap or an emulation of it.  If so, and
  HAVE_MORECORE is not true, MMAP is used for all system
  allocation. If set and HAVE_MORECORE is true as well, MMAP is
  primarily used to directly allocate very large blocks. It is also
  used as a backup strategy in cases where MORECORE fails to provide
  space from system. Note: A single call to MUNMAP is assumed to be
  able to unmap memory that may have be allocated using multiple calls
  to MMAP, so long as they are adjacent.

HAVE_MREMAP               default: 1 on linux, else 0
  If true realloc() uses mremap() to re-allocate large blocks and
  extend or shrink allocation spaces.

MMAP_CLEARS               default: 1 except on WINCE.
  True if mmap clears memory so calloc doesn't need to. This is true
  for standard unix mmap using /dev/zero and on WIN32 except for WINCE.

USE_BUILTIN_FFS            default: 0 (i.e., not used)
  Causes malloc to use the builtin ffs() function to compute indices.
  Some compilers may recognize and intrinsify ffs to be faster than the
  supplied C version. Also, the case of x86 using gcc is special-cased
  to an asm instruction, so is already as fast as it can be, and so
  this setting has no effect. Similarly for Win32 under recent MS compilers.
  (On most x86s, the asm version is only slightly faster than the C version.)

malloc_getpagesize         default: derive from system includes, or 4096.
  The system page size. To the extent possible, this malloc manages
  memory from the system in page-size units.  This may be (and
  usually is) a function rather than a constant. This is ignored
  if WIN32, where page size is determined using getSystemInfo during
  initialization.

USE_DEV_RANDOM             default: 0 (i.e., not used)
  Causes malloc to use /dev/random to initialize secure magic seed for
  stamping footers. Otherwise, the current time is used.

NO_MALLINFO                default: 0
  If defined, don't compile "mallinfo". This can be a simple way
  of dealing with mismatches between system declarations and
  those in this file.

MALLINFO_FIELD_TYPE        default: size_t
  The type of the fields in the mallinfo struct. This was originally
  defined as "int" in SVID etc, but is more usefully defined as
  size_t. The value is used only if  HAVE_USR_INCLUDE_MALLOC_H is not set

NO_MALLOC_STATS            default: 0
  If defined, don't compile "malloc_stats". This avoids calls to
  fprintf and bringing in stdio dependencies you might not want.

REALLOC_ZERO_BYTES_FREES    default: not defined
  This should be set if a call to realloc with zero bytes should
  be the same as a call to free. Some people think it should. Otherwise,
  since this malloc returns a unique pointer for malloc(0), so does
  realloc(p, 0).

LACKS_UNISTD_H, LACKS_FCNTL_H, LACKS_SYS_PARAM_H, LACKS_SYS_MMAN_H
LACKS_STRINGS_H, LACKS_STRING_H, LACKS_SYS_TYPES_H,  LACKS_ERRNO_H
LACKS_STDLIB_H LACKS_SCHED_H LACKS_TIME_H  default: NOT defined unless on WIN32
  Define these if your system does not have these header files.
  You might need to manually insert some of the declarations they provide.

DEFAULT_GRANULARITY        default: page size if MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS,
                                system_info.dwAllocationGranularity in WIN32,
                                otherwise 64K.
      Also settable using mallopt(M_GRANULARITY, x)
  The unit for allocating and deallocating memory from the system.  On
  most systems with contiguous MORECORE, there is no reason to
  make this more than a page. However, systems with MMAP tend to
  either require or encourage larger granularities.  You can increase
  this value to prevent system allocation functions to be called so
  often, especially if they are slow.  The value must be at least one
  page and must be a power of two.  Setting to 0 causes initialization
  to either page size or win32 region size.  (Note: In previous
  versions of malloc, the equivalent of this option was called
  "TOP_PAD")

DEFAULT_TRIM_THRESHOLD    default: 2MB
      Also settable using mallopt(M_TRIM_THRESHOLD, x)
  The maximum amount of unused top-most memory to keep before
  releasing via malloc_trim in free().  Automatic trimming is mainly
  useful in long-lived programs using contiguous MORECORE.  Because
  trimming via sbrk can be slow on some systems, and can sometimes be
  wasteful (in cases where programs immediately afterward allocate
  more large chunks) the value should be high enough so that your
  overall system performance would improve by releasing this much
  memory.  As a rough guide, you might set to a value close to the
  average size of a process (program) running on your system.
  Releasing this much memory would allow such a process to run in
  memory.  Generally, it is worth tuning trim thresholds when a
  program undergoes phases where several large chunks are allocated
  and released in ways that can reuse each other's storage, perhaps
  mixed with phases where there are no such chunks at all. The trim
  value must be greater than page size to have any useful effect.  To
  disable trimming completely, you can set to MAX_SIZE_T. Note that the trick
  some people use of mallocing a huge space and then freeing it at
  program startup, in an attempt to reserve system memory, doesn't
  have the intended effect under automatic trimming, since that memory
  will immediately be returned to the system.

DEFAULT_MMAP_THRESHOLD       default: 256K
      Also settable using mallopt(M_MMAP_THRESHOLD, x)
  The request size threshold for using MMAP to directly service a
  request. Requests of at least this size that cannot be allocated
  using already-existing space will be serviced via mmap.  (If enough
  normal freed space already exists it is used instead.)  Using mmap
  segregates relatively large chunks of memory so that they can be
  individually obtained and released from the host system. A request
  serviced through mmap is never reused by any other request (at least
  not directly; the system may just so happen to remap successive
  requests to the same locations).  Segregating space in this way has
  the benefits that: Mmapped space can always be individually released
  back to the system, which helps keep the system level memory demands
  of a long-lived program low.  Also, mapped memory doesn't become
  `locked' between other chunks, as can happen with normally allocated
  chunks, which means that even trimming via malloc_trim would not
  release them.  However, it has the disadvantage that the space
  cannot be reclaimed, consolidated, and then used to service later
  requests, as happens with normal chunks.  The advantages of mmap
  nearly always outweigh disadvantages for "large" chunks, but the
  value of "large" may vary across systems.  The default is an
  empirically derived value that works well in most systems. You can
  disable mmap by setting to MAX_SIZE_T.

MAX_RELEASE_CHECK_RATE   default: 4095 unless not HAVE_MMAP
  The number of consolidated frees between checks to release
  unused segments when freeing. When using non-contiguous segments,
  especially with multiple mspaces, checking only for topmost space
  doesn't always suffice to trigger trimming. To compensate for this,
  free() will, with a period of MAX_RELEASE_CHECK_RATE (or the
  current number of segments, if greater) try to release unused
  segments to the OS when freeing chunks that result in
  consolidation. The best value for this parameter is a compromise
  between slowing down frees with relatively costly checks that
  rarely trigger versus holding on to unused memory. To effectively
  disable, set to MAX_SIZE_T. This may lead to a very slight speed
  improvement at the expense of carrying around more memory.

  is itself dynamically allocated and should also be freed when it is
  no longer needed. Otherwise, the chunks array must be of at least
  n_elements in length. It is filled in with the pointers to the
  chunks.

  In either case, independent_calloc returns this pointer array, or
  null if the allocation failed.  If n_elements is zero and "chunks"
  is null, it returns a chunk representing an array with zero elements
  (which should be freed if not wanted).

  Each element must be freed when it is no longer needed. This can be
  done all at once using bulk_free.

  independent_calloc simplifies and speeds up implementations of many
  kinds of pools.  It may also be useful when constructing large data
  structures that initially have a fixed number of fixed-sized nodes,
  but the number is not known at compile time, and some of the nodes
  may later need to be freed. For example:

  struct Node { int item; struct Node* next; };

  struct Node* build_list() {
    struct Node** pool;
    int n = read_number_of_nodes_needed();
    if (n <= 0) return 0;
    pool = (struct Node**)(independent_calloc(n, sizeof(struct Node), 0);
    if (pool == 0) die();
    // organize into a linked list...
    struct Node* first = pool[0];
    for (i = 0; i < n-1; ++i)
      pool[i]->next = pool[i+1];
    free(pool);     // Can now free the array (or not, if it is needed later)
    return first;
  }
*/
DLMALLOC_EXPORT void** dlindependent_calloc(size_t, size_t, void**);

/*
  independent_comalloc(size_t n_elements, size_t sizes[], void* chunks[]);

  independent_comalloc allocates, all at once, a set of n_elements
  chunks with sizes indicated in the "sizes" array.    It returns
  an array of pointers to these elements, each of which can be
  independently freed, realloc'ed etc. The elements are guaranteed to
  be adjacently allocated (this is not guaranteed to occur with
  multiple callocs or mallocs), which may also improve cache locality
  in some applications.

  The "chunks" argument is optional (i.e., may be null). If it is null
  the returned array is itself dynamically allocated and should also
  be freed when it is no longer needed. Otherwise, the chunks array
  must be of at least n_elements in length. It is filled in with the
  pointers to the chunks.

  In either case, independent_comalloc returns this pointer array, or
  null if the allocation failed.  If n_elements is zero and chunks is
  null, it returns a chunk representing an array with zero elements
  (which should be freed if not wanted).

  Each element must be freed when it is no longer needed. This can be
  done all at once using bulk_free.

  independent_comallac differs from independent_calloc in that each
  element may have a different size, and also that it does not
  automatically clear elements.

  independent_comalloc can be used to speed up allocation in cases
  where several structs or objects must always be allocated at the
  same time.  For example:

  struct Head { ... }
  struct Foot { ... }

  void send_message(char* msg) {
    int msglen = strlen(msg);
    size_t sizes[3] = { sizeof(struct Head), msglen, sizeof(struct Foot) };
    void* chunks[3];
    if (independent_comalloc(3, sizes, chunks) == 0)
      die();
    struct Head* head = (struct Head*)(chunks[0]);
    char*        body = (char*)(chunks[1]);
    struct Foot* foot = (struct Foot*)(chunks[2]);
    // ...
  }

  In general though, independent_comalloc is worth using only for
  larger values of n_elements. For small values, you probably won't
  detect enough difference from series of malloc calls to bother.

  Overuse of independent_comalloc can increase overall memory usage,
  since it cannot reuse existing noncontiguous small chunks that
  might be available for some of the elements.

  malloc_trim(size_t pad);

  If possible, gives memory back to the system (via negative arguments

  pool or in unused MMAP segments. You can call this after freeing
  large blocks of memory to potentially reduce the system-level memory
  requirements of a program. However, it cannot guarantee to reduce
  memory. Under some allocation patterns, some large free blocks of
  memory will be locked between two used chunks, so they cannot be
  given back to the system.

  The `pad' argument to malloc_trim represents the amount of free
  trailing space to leave untrimmed. If this argument is zero, only
  the minimum amount of memory to maintain internal data structures
  will be left. Non-zero arguments can be supplied to maintain enough
  trailing space to service future expected allocations without having

  number requested. It will be larger than the number requested
  because of alignment and bookkeeping overhead. Because it includes
  alignment wastage as being in use, this figure may be greater than
  zero even when no user-level chunks are allocated.

  The reported current and maximum system memory can be inaccurate if

/*
  When locks are defined, there is one global lock, plus
  one per-mspace lock.

  The global lock_ensures that mparams.magic and other unique
  mparams values are initialized only once. It also protects
  sequences of calls to MORECORE.  In many cases sys_alloc requires
  two calls, that should not be interleaved with calls by other
  threads.  This does not protect against direct calls to MORECORE
  by other threads not using this lock, so there is still code to
  cope the best we can on interference.

  Per-mspace locks surround calls to malloc, free, etc.
  By default, locks are simple non-reentrant mutexes.

  Because lock-protected regions generally have bounded times, it is
  OK to use the supplied simple spinlocks. Spinlocks are likely to
  improve performance for lightly contended applications, but worsen
  performance under heavy contention.

  If USE_LOCKS is > 1, the definitions of lock routines here are
  bypassed, in which case you will need to define the type MLOCK_T,
  and at least INITIAL_LOCK, DESTROY_LOCK, ACQUIRE_LOCK, RELEASE_LOCK
  and TRY_LOCK.  You must also declare a
    static MLOCK_T malloc_global_mutex = { initialization values };.

/*
  (The following includes lightly edited explanations by Colin Plumb.)

  The malloc_chunk declaration below is misleading (but accurate and
  necessary).  It declares a "view" into memory allowing access to
  necessary fields at known offsets from a given base.

  Chunks of memory are maintained using a `boundary tag' method as
  originally described by Knuth.  (See the paper by Paul Wilson
  ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/allocsrv.ps for a survey of such
  techniques.)  Sizes of free chunks are stored both in the front of
  each chunk and at the end.  This makes consolidating fragmented
  chunks into bigger chunks fast.  The head fields also hold bits
  representing whether chunks are free or in use.

  Here are some pictures to make it clearer.  They are "exploded" to
  show that the state of a chunk can be thought of as extending from
  the high 31 bits of the head field of its header through the
  prev_foot and PINUSE_BIT bit of the following chunk header.

  A chunk that's in use looks like:

   chunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
           | Size of previous chunk (if P = 0)                             |

         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |P|

         +-                                                             -+

         +-                                                             -+
         |                                                               :
         +-      size - sizeof(size_t) available payload bytes          -+
         :                                                               |

                                                                     +-+
  Note that since we always merge adjacent free chunks, the chunks
  adjacent to a free chunk must be in use.

  Given a pointer to a chunk (which can be derived trivially from the
  payload pointer) we can, in O(1) time, find out whether the adjacent
  chunks are free, and if so, unlink them from the lists that they
  are on and merge them with the current chunk.

  Chunks always begin on even word boundaries, so the mem portion
  (which is returned to the user) is also on an even word boundary, and
  thus at least double-word aligned.

  The P (PINUSE_BIT) bit, stored in the unused low-order bit of the
  chunk size (which is always a multiple of two words), is an in-use
  bit for the *previous* chunk.  If that bit is *clear*, then the
  word before the current chunk size contains the previous chunk
  size, and can be used to find the front of the previous chunk.
  The very first chunk allocated always has this bit set, preventing
  access to non-existent (or non-owned) memory. If pinuse is set for
  any given chunk, then you CANNOT determine the size of the
  previous chunk, and might even get a memory addressing fault when
  trying to do so.

  The C (CINUSE_BIT) bit, stored in the unused second-lowest bit of
  the chunk size redundantly records whether the current chunk is
  inuse (unless the chunk is mmapped). This redundancy enables usage
  checks within free and realloc, and reduces indirection when freeing
  and consolidating chunks.

  Each freshly allocated chunk must have both cinuse and pinuse set.
  That is, each allocated chunk borders either a previously allocated
  and still in-use chunk, or the base of its memory arena. This is
  ensured by making all allocations from the `lowest' part of any
  found chunk.  Further, no free chunk physically borders another one,
  so each free chunk is known to be preceded and followed by either
  inuse chunks or the ends of memory.

  Note that the `foot' of the current chunk is actually represented
  as the prev_foot of the NEXT chunk. This makes it easier to
  deal with alignments etc but can be very confusing when trying
  to extend or adapt this code.

  The exceptions to all this are

     1. The special chunk `top' is the top-most available chunk (i.e.,
        the one bordering the end of available memory). It is treated
        specially.  Top is never included in any bin, is used only if
        no other chunk is available, and is released back to the
        system if it is very large (see M_TRIM_THRESHOLD).  In effect,
        the top chunk is treated as larger (and thus less well
        fitting) than any other available chunk.  The top chunk
        doesn't update its trailing size field since there is no next
        contiguous chunk that would have to index off it. However,
        space is still allocated for it (TOP_FOOT_SIZE) to enable
        separation or merging when space is extended.

     3. Chunks allocated via mmap, have both cinuse and pinuse bits
        cleared in their head fields.  Because they are allocated
        one-by-one, each must carry its own prev_foot field, which is
        also used to hold the offset this chunk has within its mmapped
        region, which is needed to preserve alignment. Each mmapped
        chunk is trailed by the first two fields of a fake next-chunk
        for sake of usage checks.

  Each tree holding treenodes is a tree of unique chunk sizes.  Chunks
  of the same size are arranged in a circularly-linked list, with only
  the oldest chunk (the next to be used, in our FIFO ordering)
  actually in the tree.  (Tree members are distinguished by a non-null
  parent pointer.)  If a chunk with the same size an an existing node
  is inserted, it is linked off the existing node using pointers that
  work in the same way as fd/bk pointers of small chunks.

  Each tree contains a power of 2 sized range of chunk sizes (the
  smallest is 0x100 <= x < 0x180), which is is divided in half at each
  tree level, with the chunks in the smaller half of the range (0x100
  <= x < 0x140 for the top nose) in the left subtree and the larger
  half (0x140 <= x < 0x180) in the right subtree.  This is, of course,
  done by inspecting individual bits.

  Using these rules, each node's left subtree contains all smaller
  sizes than its right subtree.  However, the node at the root of each
  subtree has no particular ordering relationship to either.  (The
  dividing line between the subtree sizes is based on trie relation.)
  If we remove the last chunk of a given size from the interior of the
  tree, we need to replace it with a leaf node.  The tree ordering
  rules permit a node to be replaced by any leaf below it.

  The smallest chunk in a tree (a common operation in a best-fit
  allocator) can be found by walking a path to the leftmost leaf in
  the tree.  Unlike a usual binary tree, where we follow left child
  pointers until we reach a null, here we follow the right child
  pointer any time the left one is null, until we reach a leaf with
  both child pointers null. The smallest chunk in the tree will be
  somewhere along that path.

  The worst case number of steps to add, find, or remove a node is
  bounded by the number of bits differentiating chunks within
  bins. Under current bin calculations, this ranges from 6 up to 21
  (for 32 bit sizes) or up to 53 (for 64 bit sizes). The typical case
  is of course much better.

/* ----------------------------- Segments -------------------------------- */

/*
  Each malloc space may include non-contiguous segments, held in a
  list headed by an embedded malloc_segment record representing the
  top-most space. Segments also include flags holding properties of
  the space. Large chunks that are directly allocated by mmap are not
  included in this list. They are instead independently created and
  destroyed without otherwise keeping track of them.

  Segment management mainly comes into play for spaces allocated by
  MMAP.  Any call to MMAP might or might not return memory that is
  adjacent to an existing segment.  MORECORE normally contiguously
  extends the current space, so this space is almost always adjacent,
  which is simpler and faster to deal with. (This is why MORECORE is
  used preferentially to MMAP when both are available -- see
  sys_alloc.)  When allocating using MMAP, we don't use any of the
  hinting mechanisms (inconsistently) supported in various
  implementations of unix mmap, or distinguish reserving from
  committing memory. Instead, we just ask for space, and exploit
  contiguity when we get it.  It is probably possible to do
  better than this on some systems, but no general scheme seems
  to be significantly better.

  Management entails a simpler variant of the consolidation scheme
  used for chunks to reduce fragmentation -- new adjacent memory is
  normally prepended or appended to an existing segment. However,
  there are limitations compared to chunk consolidation that mostly
  reflect the fact that segment processing is relatively infrequent
  (occurring only when getting memory from system) and that we
  don't expect to have huge numbers of segments:

  * Segments are not indexed, so traversal requires linear scans.  (It
    would be possible to index these, but is not worth the extra
    overhead and complexity for most programs on most platforms.)
  * New segments are only appended to old ones when holding top-most
    memory; if they cannot be prepended to others, they are held in
    different segments.

  Except for the top-most segment of an mstate, each segment record
  is kept at the tail of its segment. Segments are added by pushing
  segment records onto the list headed by &mstate.seg for the
  containing mstate.

  Segment flags control allocation/merge/deallocation policies:
  * If EXTERN_BIT set, then we did not allocate this segment,
    and so should not try to deallocate or merge with others.
    (This currently holds only for the initial segment passed
    into create_mspace_with_base.)
  * If USE_MMAP_BIT set, the segment may be merged with
    other surrounding mmapped segments and trimmed/de-allocated
    using munmap.
  * If neither bit is set, then the segment was obtained using
    MORECORE so can be merged with surrounding MORECORE'd segments
    and deallocated/trimmed using MORECORE with negative arguments.

/* ---------------------------- malloc_state ----------------------------- */

/*
   A malloc_state holds all of the bookkeeping for a space.
   The main fields are:

  Top
    The topmost chunk of the currently active segment. Its size is
    cached in topsize.  The actual size of topmost space is
    topsize+TOP_FOOT_SIZE, which includes space reserved for adding
    fenceposts and segment records if necessary when getting more
    space from the system.  The size at which to autotrim top is
    cached from mparams in trim_check, except that it is disabled if
    an autotrim fails.

  Designated victim (dv)
    This is the preferred chunk for servicing small requests that
    don't have exact fits.  It is normally the chunk split off most
    recently to service another small request.  Its size is cached in
    dvsize. The link fields of this chunk are not maintained since it
    is not kept in a bin.

  SmallBins
    An array of bin headers for free chunks.  These bins hold chunks
    with sizes less than MIN_LARGE_SIZE bytes. Each bin contains
    chunks of all the same size, spaced 8 bytes apart.  To simplify
    use in double-linked lists, each bin header acts as a malloc_chunk
    pointing to the real first node, if it exists (else pointing to
    itself).  This avoids special-casing for headers.  But to avoid
    waste, we allocate only the fd/bk pointers of bins, and then use
    repositioning tricks to treat these as the fields of a chunk.

  TreeBins
    Treebins are pointers to the roots of trees holding a range of
    sizes. There are 2 equally spaced treebins for each power of two
    from TREE_SHIFT to TREE_SHIFT+16. The last bin holds anything
    larger.

  Bin maps
    There is one bit map for small bins ("smallmap") and one for
    treebins ("treemap).  Each bin sets its bit when non-empty, and
    clears the bit when empty.  Bit operations are then used to avoid
    bin-by-bin searching -- nearly all "search" is done without ever
    looking at bins that won't be selected.  The bit maps
    conservatively use 32 bits per map word, even if on 64bit system.
    For a good description of some of the bit-based techniques used
    here, see Henry S. Warren Jr's book "Hacker's Delight" (and
    supplement at http://hackersdelight.org/). Many of these are
    intended to reduce the branchiness of paths through malloc etc, as
    well as to reduce the number of memory locations read or written.

  Segments
    A list of segments headed by an embedded malloc_segment record
    representing the initial space.

  Address check support
    The least_addr field is the least address ever obtained from
    MORECORE or MMAP. Attempted frees and reallocs of any address less
    than this are trapped (unless INSECURE is defined).

  Magic tag
    A cross-check field that should always hold same value as mparams._magic.

  Max allowed footprint
    The maximum allowed bytes to allocate from system (zero means no limit)

  Flags
    Bits recording whether to use MMAP, locks, or contiguous MORECORE

  Statistics
    Each space keeps track of current and maximum system memory
    obtained via MORECORE or MMAP.

  Trim support
    Fields holding the amount of unused topmost memory that should trigger
    trimming, and a counter to force periodic scanning to release unused
    non-topmost segments.

  Locking
    If USE_LOCKS is defined, the "mutex" lock is acquired and released
    around every public call using this mspace.

  Extension support
    A void* pointer and a size_t field that can be used to help implement
    extensions to this malloc.

    /*
      For security, the main invariant is that malloc/free/etc never
      writes to a static address other than malloc_state, unless static
      malloc_state itself has been corrupted, which cannot occur via
      malloc (because of these checks). In essence this means that we
      believe all pointers, sizes, maps etc held in malloc_state, but
      check all of those linked or offsetted from other embedded data
      structures.  These checks are interspersed with main code in a way
      that tends to minimize their run-time cost.

      When FOOTERS is defined, in addition to range checking, we also
      verify footer fields of inuse chunks, which can be used guarantee
      that the mstate controlling malloc/free is intact.  This is a
      streamlined version of the approach described by William Robertson
      et al in "Run-time Detection of Heap-based Overflows" LISA'03
      http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa03/tech/robertson.html The footer
      of an inuse chunk holds the xor of its mstate and a random seed,
      that is checked upon calls to free() and realloc().  This is
      (probabalistically) unguessable from outside the program, but can be
      computed by any code successfully malloc'ing any chunk, so does not
      itself provide protection against code that has already broken
      security through some other means.  Unlike Robertson et al, we
      always dynamically check addresses of all offset chunks (previous,
      next, etc). This turns out to be cheaper than relying on hashes.

  Unlink steps:

  1. If x is a chained node, unlink it from its same-sized fd/bk links
     and choose its bk node as its replacement.
  2. If x was the last node of its size, but not a leaf node, it must
     be replaced with a leaf node (not merely one with an open left or
     right), to make sure that lefts and rights of descendents
     correspond properly to bit masks.  We use the rightmost descendent
     of x.  We could use any other leaf, but this is easy to locate and
     tends to counteract removal of leftmosts elsewhere, and so keeps
     paths shorter than minimally guaranteed.  This doesn't loop much
     because on average a node in a tree is near the bottom.
  3. If x is the base of a chain (i.e., has parent links) relink
     x's parent and children to x's replacement (or null if none).

      Try getting memory in any of three ways (in most-preferred to
      least-preferred order):
      1. A call to MORECORE that can normally contiguously extend memory.
      (disabled if not MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS or not HAVE_MORECORE or
      or main space is mmapped or a previous contiguous call failed)
      2. A call to MMAP new space (disabled if not HAVE_MMAP).
      Note that under the default settings, if MORECORE is unable to
      fulfill a request, and HAVE_MMAP is true, then mmap is
      used as a noncontiguous system allocator. This is a useful backup
      strategy for systems with holes in address spaces -- in this case
      sbrk cannot contiguously expand the heap, but mmap may be able to
      find space.
      3. A call to MORECORE that cannot usually contiguously extend memory.
      (disabled if not HAVE_MORECORE)

      In all cases, we need to request enough bytes from system to ensure
      we can malloc nb bytes upon success, so pad with enough space for
      top_foot, plus alignment-pad to make sure we don't lose bytes if
      not on boundary, and round this up to a granularity unit.

      3. If one exists, split the smallest available chunk in a bin,
      saving remainder in dv.
      4. If it is big enough, use the top chunk.
      5. If available, get memory from system and use it
      Otherwise, for a large request:
      1. Find the smallest available binned chunk that fits, and use it
      if it is better fitting than dv chunk, splitting if necessary.
      2. If better fitting than any binned chunk, use the dv chunk.
      3. If it is big enough, use the top chunk.

/* -------------------- Alternative MORECORE functions ------------------- */

/*
  Guidelines for creating a custom version of MORECORE:

  * For best performance, MORECORE should allocate in multiples of pagesize.
  * MORECORE may allocate more memory than requested. (Or even less,
      but this will usually result in a malloc failure.)
  * MORECORE must not allocate memory when given argument zero, but
      instead return one past the end address of memory from previous
      nonzero call.
  * For best performance, consecutive calls to MORECORE with positive
      arguments should return increasing addresses, indicating that
      space has been contiguously extended.
  * Even though consecutive calls to MORECORE need not return contiguous
      addresses, it must be OK for malloc'ed chunks to span multiple
      regions in those cases where they do happen to be contiguous.
  * MORECORE need not handle negative arguments -- it may instead
      just return MFAIL when given negative arguments.
      Negative arguments are always multiples of pagesize. MORECORE
      must not misinterpret negative args as large positive unsigned
      args. You can suppress all such calls from even occurring by defining
      MORECORE_CANNOT_TRIM,

  As an example alternative MORECORE, here is a custom allocator
  kindly contributed for pre-OSX macOS.  It uses virtually but not
  necessarily physically contiguous non-paged memory (locked in,
  present and won't get swapped out).  You can use it by uncommenting
  this section, adding some #includes, and setting up the appropriate
  defines above:

      #define MORECORE osMoreCore

  There is also a shutdown routine that should somehow be called for
  cleanup upon program exit.

  #define MAX_POOL_ENTRIES 100
  #define MINIMUM_MORECORE_SIZE  (64 * 1024U)
  static int next_os_pool;
  void *our_os_pools[MAX_POOL_ENTRIES];

  void *osMoreCore(int size)
  {
    void *ptr = 0;
    static void *sbrk_top = 0;

    if (size > 0)
    {
      if (size < MINIMUM_MORECORE_SIZE)
         size = MINIMUM_MORECORE_SIZE;
      if (CurrentExecutionLevel() == kTaskLevel)
         ptr = PoolAllocateResident(size + RM_PAGE_SIZE, 0);
      if (ptr == 0)
      {
        return (void *) MFAIL;
      }
      // save ptrs so they can be freed during cleanup
      our_os_pools[next_os_pool] = ptr;
      next_os_pool++;
      ptr = (void *) ((((size_t) ptr) + RM_PAGE_MASK) & ~RM_PAGE_MASK);
      sbrk_top = (char *) ptr + size;
      return ptr;
    }
    else if (size < 0)
    {
      // we don't currently support shrink behavior
      return (void *) MFAIL;
    }
    else
    {
      return sbrk_top;
    }
  }

  // cleanup any allocated memory pools
  // called as last thing before shutting down driver

  void osCleanupMem(void)
  {
    void **ptr;

    for (ptr = our_os_pools; ptr < &our_os_pools[MAX_POOL_ENTRIES]; ptr++)
      if (*ptr)
      {

           usage of 'assert' in non-WIN32 code
         * Improve WIN32 'sbrk()' emulation's 'findRegion()' routine to
           avoid infinite loop

    V2.6.2 Tue Dec  5 06:52:55 1995  Doug Lea  (dl at gee)
      * Integrated most documentation with the code.
      * Add support for mmap, with help from
        Wolfram Gloger (Gloger@lrz.uni-muenchen.de).
      * Use last_remainder in more cases.
      * Pack bins using idea from  colin@nyx10.cs.du.edu

      * Re-tuned and fixed to behave more nicely with V2.6.0 changes.
      * Removed all preallocation code since under current scheme
        the work required to undo bad preallocations exceeds
        the work saved in good cases for most test programs.
      * No longer use return list or unconsolidated bins since
        no scheme using them consistently outperforms those that don't
        given above changes.

      * Use bin counts as a guide to preallocation
      * Occasionally bin return list chunks in first scan
      * Add a few optimizations from colin@nyx10.cs.du.edu

      * merged all consolidations to one part of malloc proper
         (eliminating old malloc_find_space & malloc_clean_bin)
      * Scan 2 returns chunks (not just 1)
      * Propagate failure in realloc if malloc returns 0
      * Add stuff to allow compilation on non-ANSI compilers

          with gcc & native cc (hp, dec only) allowing
          Detlefs & Zorn comparison study (in SIGPLAN Notices.)

    Trial version Fri Aug 28 13:14:29 1992  Doug Lea  (dl at g.oswego.edu)
      * Based loosely on libg++-1.2X malloc. (It retains some of the overall
         structure of old version,  but most details differ.)
